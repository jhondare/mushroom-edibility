# <b> Mushroom Classification </b> 


<h2> This repository contains code for the classification of mushrooms into edible and non-edible</h2>

<p> The dataset being used consists of 5 (four) edible  and 4 (five) Poisonous mushrooms. </p> 

<p> Convolutional Neural Network is used as the algorithm, whilst 4 deep learning architectures are used also thereon, and they are::</p>
<br>  1 - ResNet
<br>  2 - LeNet
<br>  3 - MobileNet 
<br>  4 - EfficientNet 

<p> after training the dataset for maximum of 50 epochs for each architecture, we arrived at the following  accuracies </p> 
<br>  ResNet          -   (0.7519333729922665)
<br>  LeNet           -   (0.7668054729327781)
<br>  MobileNet       -   (0.33967876264128494)
<br>  EfficientNet    -   (0.7958579659461975)
